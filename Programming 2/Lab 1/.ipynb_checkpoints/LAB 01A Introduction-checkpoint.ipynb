    "Python is a powerful and extensible programming language well-suited to a wide range of tasks. In these sessions you will be introduced to Python as a programming language, and as a tool that can be used to analyse data taken in Engineering experiments. As a programming language it is easy to learn, powerful, and will introduce you to good programming habits. You will also find it a more powerful and flexible way to handle data compared to Excel, with libraries that can handle professional statistical analysis and graph plotting.\n",

    "You will use Jupyter Notebooks as a useful way to keep both code, and results, in an organised fashion."

    "\n",
    "## What is Python?\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is an interpreted high-level programming language for a wide range of programming tasks.\n",
    "But what does that mean?:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Interpreted - Python does not require 'compiling', you can run your script as soon as you've written it and you can even run small snippets directly in a Python console.\n",
    "* High-level - the code you write in Python is relatively human-readable and very different to the instructions received by the computer when your code runs.\n",
    "* Programming - using a set of instructions for computers to create algorithms that complete a task, usually to make our lives more efficent.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Guido van Rossum released the first version of Python in 1991.\n",
    "Python's philosophy of readability and simplicity has made it an extremely popular programming language.\n",
    "Python is used for research, teaching and data science across the globe and some of its more famous users include Wikipedia, Google, NASA and Reddit (which is almost entirely written in Python).\n",
    "Unlike some other coding systems, such as MATLAB or R, Python has not been designed with a particular use case in mind; instead, Python is heavily extensible through modules that have been designed for specific tasks.\n",
    "By combining modules together Python can be used to easily compute anything that can be done in other languages in a way that is both quick to code and quick to run.\n",
    "Beyond modules for analysis and processing, there are many modules for one-, two- and three- dimensional plotting.\n",
    "During the labs you will be expected to use a range of these modules.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What are Jupyter Notebooks?\n",
    "\n",
    "Short calculations can be executed directly from a Python console/terminal, similar to what you would do on a pocket calculator.\n",
    "However, more extensive calculations, or procedures that you want to repeat several times, are more conveniently programmed in short scripts (often saved as `.py` files).\n",
    "In scientific computing and data science we often want more than just a script, we want to combine our thoughts and assumptions, codes, outputs and conclusions and we want to do this in a way that's easy to share and reproduce.\n",
    "\n",
    "Enter Jupyter Notebooks (formerly IPython Notebooks) a web-based interactive environment for creating 'notebooks' that contain cells of information.\n",
    "Each cell can be text (using Markdown), code (Python), mathematics (using the markup language $\\LaTeX$), plots and other media.\n",
    "Each notebook is saved as a `.ipynb` file, which is easy to send to a collaborator should they need to see the steps taken to get from A to B.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here at the University of Glasgow, we're running a 'Jupyter Hub', a multi-user server that allows each of you to have your own Jupyter Notebook environment for completing the programming unit, for use throughout the labs, and future applications throughout your studies at the University of Glasgow.\n",
    "We strongly encourage you to create a new notebook for each practical experiment you do - all your data analysis can be compeleted using Python."

    "# Assessment\n",
    "\n",
    "Your Python exercises are assessed continuously during the sessions. Once you have completed one of the exercises, show and explain it to one of the demonstrators, who will then enter your mark on the marking sheet. You can also talk to demonstrators if you get stuck or if you want to discuss any aspects of your programming. They will be able to give you advice on good programming style, how to write effective and clear code, and how to go about testing and tracking down any errors in your code. There is also no problem about disussing your programming efforts and challenges with your peers - although you will have to explain what ***you*** have done to the lab demonstrators for marking. Marks are for individuals.\n",
    "\n",
    "Make sure you have all your work marked and signed for as soon as possible in order to avoid a build up of unmarked material at the end of the sessions - labs finish at midday, and demonstrators will not stay longer for additional marking."

    "\n",
    "It is good practice to comment your codes so the reader (which might be you when you next look at it) knows how you arrived at your answer, or how to interpret the result.  In a Jupyter Notebook you should do this in two ways:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. By using a Markdown cell (such as this one) to write a chunk of formatted text. Markdown cells can use rich formatting, HTML and $\\LaTeX$ allowing you to include images, videos, formulae and maths. Throughout the course you will be asked questions which you should answer in cells like this.\n",
    "2. By commenting the Python code itself (see below).\n",

    "In the top panel you can see that this cell is a Markdown cell.\n",
    "You can switch between different styles by selecting e.g. \"Code\" from the drop-down menu.\n",

    "\n",
    "## Python Comments\n",

    "```\n",
