    "# Assigning and Using Variables\n",
    "\n",
    "Programming languages use variables (names) to refer to objects, such as numbers, that you will use over again. In Python, variables are assigned with the `=` symbol, e.g. `a = 3`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Variables can hold almost anything, but we will usually use them to store a number (or an array of multiple numbers). Python and Numpy both have their own data types, some of which we will cover in this course.\n",
    "Once defined, the variable `a` can be used over and over again (see the cell below).\n",
    "Variables can be used to store information but you can also do calculations with variables, e.g. `c = a+b`, just like you would with numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Printing Variables\n",
    "\n",
    "We may want to check on the value stored in a variable. We can do this using the `print()` function. It is also possible to print out some text (text is referred to in programming as a \"string\"). You can write a string by surrounding your text with quotation marks. Run the cell below to see all this in action.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Comments\n",
    "You will have noticed that the example code often contains *comments* (which start with the `#` character). You can write any text you want after the `#` character and that text will not be treated like a program to be run. It is just an informative comment for the benefit of you and anybody else reading your code. Good code contains comments that explain what the surrounding code is doing (e.g. 'calculate the length of the hypotenuse', and (for more complex code) the higher-level *purpose* of a whole larger chunk of code (e.g. 'Integrate over a circle using Simpson's rule')"

We will not discuss all the details this piece of relatively advanced syntax, but you should learn from examples like the ones below, and make use of them in the code you write in figure.
