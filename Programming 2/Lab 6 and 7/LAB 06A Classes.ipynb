    "# Classes, and their Objects\n",
    "\n",
    "One very powerful feature of advanced high level programming languages is the ability to define Objects, which combine data and functions/methods. In order to create an Object, we first define a Class (the 'type' of the new object), and then Objects becoe instances of this Class.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example a Class of type Car could be defined as:\n",
    "```Python\n",
    "class Car(): \n",
    "\"\"\"Model a Car.\"\"\"\n",
    "def __init__(self, make, model):\n",
    "    \"\"\"Initialise\"\"\" ",

    "    self.model = model\n",
    "    self.tank_cap = 60          #60 litre tank\n",
    "    self.tank = 0               #initial fuel fill ",

    "def ...                          #other functions and private vars```\n",
    "and then we could use that Class to create a specific Object, and then operate on that Object\n",
    "```Python\n",
    "myCar = Car('nissan', 'micra')   # create/instantiate an object called myCar\n",

    "\n",
    "Last time you created some helper functions to draw roguelike rooms. Now we will create a Class called a Room, from which we can make room objects. \n",
    "\n",
    "* define a class of type Room, with an `__init__` function which takes two values, a width and a height, and uses those to define the object's room size. You should also define class variables `x`,`y` which give the initial location of the user in the room (best to make this location (0,0) to start with). \n",
    "* write a helper function/method for your class which allows the room to draw itself\n",
    "* write class functions/methods named `left`, `right`, `up`, `down` which change he location of the user in the room - taking proper account of the room walls!\n",
